There are several ways to make this quiz more dynamic. Here are a few suggestions:

    Randomize the questions: Instead of presenting the questions in a fixed order, you could randomize the order in which the questions are presented to the user. This would make the quiz more interesting and challenging, as the user would have to think on their feet.

    Add more questions: You could add more questions to the quiz to increase its size and make it more challenging. You could even create different categories of questions (such as beginner, intermediate, and advanced) and allow the user to select the level they want to play at.

    Time the quiz: You could add a timer to the quiz to make it more challenging. For example, you could give the user a certain amount of time to answer each question, and if they don't answer within the time limit, the quiz moves on to the next question.

    Provide feedback: After the user answers each question, you could provide them with feedback on whether they got the answer right or wrong, and explain why. This would help the user to learn from their mistakes and improve their knowledge.

    Allow the user to review their answers: After the quiz is complete, you could allow the user to review their answers and see which questions they got right and wrong. This would help the user to identify areas where they need to improve and focus their future studies.
